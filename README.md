# blender-face-sets

Adds a more intuitive way to interact with sets of faces.

Internally, face sets are stored as a regular boolean attribute, so they can be manipulated and read via Geometry Nodes, as you would any other attribute.

## How To Use

When a mesh is selected and in edit mode, in the mesh data panel there will be a new menu "Face Sets". Adding faces to a face set behaves the same way as adding a vertex to a vertex group.
